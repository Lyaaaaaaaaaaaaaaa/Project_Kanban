# CODE_OF_CONDUCT
## What is required
* Using welcoming and proper language
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Stay polite! Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks won't be tolerated.
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting isn't either.

This code is pretty simple. It takes effect issues, pulls request, suggestion and on discord. It applies to any one part of this project or taking part in discussions. If you can't respect these simple rules, I will have to remove issues, comments, and PR related to the violation. If it doesn't stop, I will have to block accounts related to it on all communication support we have.
If you need to report something, use discord and PM *(private message)* me.
