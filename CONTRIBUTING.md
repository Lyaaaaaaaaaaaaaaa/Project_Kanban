# CONTRIBUTING

Thank you for considering contributing to my humble project! It's very kind. 
However, be sure to read the code of conduit and guidelines before to contribute.
*You can find the links in Useful resources chapter.*

## How to file a bug report?
Go in **issues**, then click on **new issue** and select **bug report**

## How to suggest a new feature?
Go in **issues**, then click on **new issue** and select **Feature request**. Any suggestion is welcome! Of course, everything isn't possible, but giving your opinion or thought about improving this project is good.

## How to set up your environment and run tests?
You will need Python installed and the yaml package. Otherwise, you can use any text editor. I personally use the Gnome Builder.
To run the interface you will require GTK.
Edit whatever you want and run main.py to start the software.

    1. Either open the downloaded branch with [Gnome Builder](https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Builder)
    2. Or [build it yourself](https://docs.flatpak.org/en/latest/building-introduction.html)

## The types of contributions I'm looking for
I'm looking for contributions of any type. As long as you feel useful to contribute, do so! You can contribute by making some doc (Once the project is advanced enough to have need of a doc), giving some design advice or even suggestions. Of course, someone with knowledge in Python programming or GTK is welcome too :).
