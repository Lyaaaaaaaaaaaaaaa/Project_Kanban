## Why use Project Kanban and not another application?
Here are reasons to use this software:

**You**
1. Don't want an unnecessarily complicated and heavy application.
2. You don't like mandatory Agile methodology
3. You want a desktop application and not a server architecture or web app
4. You don't like accepting '*Use policy*'
5. You work on personnal project and don't need to share it with a team
6. You like the auto saving applications :).
